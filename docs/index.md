# Regina Field Toolkit

The Regina Field Toolkit is a Python package for exploring the structural geometry of the prime numbers uncovered by the Regina Field hypothesis.

It provides:

- dataset loaders  
- zone classifiers  
- shell/entropy/curvature tiers  
- Hilbert envelope analysis  
- Royal prime classification  
- structural scoring  
- visualization utilities  
- CLI commands  

This library is designed to work directly with published Regina Field datasets.
